vagrant-ubuntu14
================

This is a Vagrant build of a very basic LAMP server.

Most of this is based on the vagrant cloud box [notgary/ubuntu-14-04-base](https://vagrantcloud.com/notgary/boxes/ubuntu-14-04-base) and all credit is owed to them. 

I simply added basic provisioning for: 
Apache 2.2
MySQL 5.5
PHP Version 5.5

This is meant for local and dev use only. This is not a production server. 

MySQL Root Password: pass
